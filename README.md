# BurgerWebViewer

This project is a web-based viewer for [Burger](https://github.com/mcdevs/burger) data.  It is based on [Hamburglar](https://github.com/pokechu22/hamburglar) and [BurgerVitrine](https://github.com/pokechu22/burgervitrine), using [Brython](http://brython.info/) to run these in the browser.  Note that it does _not_ run burger directly; it works off of pregenerated burger JSON data.

This project is similar to what b.wiki.vg ([BurgerVitrineServer](https://github.com/sadimusi/BurgerVitrineServer)) did, but it doesn't generate the data itself (and also is actually online still).

This project was previously located on the [gh-pages branch of my burger repo](https://github.com/pokechu22/burger/tree/gh-pages), alongside the generated burger JSON data.  I've split it off to make it easier to keep track of changes to it.
